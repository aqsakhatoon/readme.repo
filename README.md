## How to Set Up a New Node Project:
- Create a new folder for your first new node project.
    - mkdir my-first-node-proj
- Initialize NPM inside the project folder.
    - npm init
- Make your entry point.
    - Make sure you specify a name file in your setup because node will try to look for a file called "index.js". (Naming it 'index.js' will be best.)
- Double check your Node is working by adding a console.log in your index.js. Here is an example:
        - console.log("hello")
- Run your program!
    - In order to run a file in Node through the command line you need to write the following code:
    - node [file name here]
    - node index.js


## How to Clone Down/Set-Up a Repo That Uses Node Packages
- After cloning repo and opening repo on code editor, you will have to reinstall npm dependencies. 
    - ".gitignore": ensures github NPMs files/libraries.
